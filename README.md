# Var3. Staff management system.
Imagine, you are developing a staff management system for a mid-size corporation.
You need to keep all organizational structure in memory: departments, employees,
their personal data, positions, salaries, history of growth, who is whose boss, etc.
It is expected that your class has following methods:
* Display methods and properties to navigate by staff tree: get boss/subordinates list by employee identifiers (name, phone, email, ...)
* Add/fire employees
* Change salary/position/... for a group of employees
* Select workers by some filter
